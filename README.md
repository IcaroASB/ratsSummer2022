<h2> Chris Kevin Basa Andrade </h2>
<p> Hello fellow humans! I'm Chris, I'm gonna be a senior at Lehman College this coming Fall. I'm a Computer Science major and am planning to tack on some Minors but I keep forgetting to talk to my academic advisor. People tend to think I don't like talk much or socialize, but I prefer looking at it as I listen more than I talk. I'm from the Philippines and I've been watching anime and reading manga even when it was cool to bully people who like those. I like to talk and listen about Minecraft, Politics, Marvel, Building PCs, to reminiscing what a disappointment the last season of Game of Thrones was, and everything in between. </p>
